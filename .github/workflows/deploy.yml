# Environment variables that are available to all jobs within this workflow.
# This makes it easy to reference these values without repeating them.
env:
  # The AWS region where your ECR repository exists. It reads from the GitHub secret.

  # The full URI of your ECR repository. It also reads from the GitHub secret.

# 'jobs' defines a sequence of tasks to be executed.
jobs:
  # We have one job named 'build-and-push'.

      # This downloads your source code (including the Dockerfile) onto the virtual machine.
